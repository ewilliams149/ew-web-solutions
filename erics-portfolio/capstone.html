                <p>For my capstone project, our client wanted a website built for Lego lovers where they could have the ability to buy and sell Lego sets and parts or add them to their collection or wish list. At first, this seemed like a daunting task, but by taking it one step at a time, we managed to accomplish a lot as a team. I was one of two designers for this project, and some of my accomplishments include creating the mood board, where I chose the color palette, typography and design and graphical elements</p>

            <div>
                <p>Our client told us that he wanted this to be a colorful and kid-friendly website, so that was the reasoning behind these design choices. I then created the style guide, where I established guidelines like padding and colors for various elements, responsive typography, grids for mobile and desktop view, icons to be used on the site, and other general styling guidelines.</p>

                <p>We then worked together to create high fidelity wireframes for the website using Figma, with our top priority being making the final product as user-friendly as possible. We used the CSS extension language Sass to style the site, which was a bit of a learning curve as we’re not used to Sass, but it was worth it in the end as we came out with more skills to bring into the workforce. This project had its challenges, but I’m proud of what we were able to accomplish with this one.</p>
